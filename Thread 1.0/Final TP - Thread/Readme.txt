Thread
\i0  is a navigation iPhone app based off the story of Theseus in the labyrinth with the minotaur. In order to escape the labyrinth, Theseus laid out a thread from the point of entry into the maze and was able to traverse his way back by following the thread that he strung out. \
\
Similar to this story, after tapping your screen, Thread records your current location and then begins to record all of the locations (latitude and longitude) that you pass over into a list as you go on your adventure. You are essentially laying out a digital thread as you walk around. After you tap and tell the app that you want to stop recording your change in location and want to head back to where you began, the app will then direct you back towards your original location.\
\
The main application of this technology in my opinion would be for hiking. When hiking it is advised to stay on the trail and avoid unplanned trailblazing because of the risk of getting lost. With Thread, a user will be able to easily find their way back. This can also be used for navigating through cities, through large buildings, kayaking, and finding your way back to a parked car, night jogs, and more!\
\

\b How to run the project:\

\b0 You must have Pythonista installed on your phone. Pythonista is an iOS python compiler that has its own libraries for of phone-based functions. After opening the file on Pythonista (sidenote: There can only be one file for all the code because Pythonista does not run more than one file at a time) you have to press the run button on the top and the app will function as desired. You can use iCloud, messages, Airdrop, email, or copy/paste to get the code from your computer to Pythonista to run.\
\

\b Libraries:\

\b0 All of the libraries needed to run Thread are already installed when you download Pythonista.\
Here are the libraries used: motion, scene, math, time, sound, location, copy, webbrowser, clipboard, photos, ui, console, datetime, time, gmtime, strftime\
\

\b Shortcut Commands:\

\b0 You may paste this data set into the variable \'93self.locations\'94 to preload locations into the app for testing.\
Data set: [(40.429,-79.9594),(40.4288,-79.9598),(40.4285,-79.9601),(40.4284,-79.9605),(40.4281,-79.9608),(40.4279,-79.9612),(40.4277,-79.9616),(40.4275,-79.962),(40.4273,-79.9623),(40.4273,-79.9628),(40.4275,-79.9632),(40.4277,-79.9635),(40.4278,-79.9637),(40.4279,-79.9639),(40.4281,-79.9642),(40.4287,-79.965)]\
